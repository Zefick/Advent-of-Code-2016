# Advent of Code

Solutions for programming puzzles from the <a href='http://adventofcode.com/2015'>Advent of Code 2015</a> and <a href='http://adventofcode.com/2016'>2016</a>.

Solving this puzzles I tried to find interesting solutions using only the base Java API, specifically streams. The code written for fun and doesn't reflect my own programming style. Sometimes I safrificed optimality in return for beauty and compactness.

As soon as an input data always known and more or less equal for any user the code often solves a puzzles for such input but not for any possible input. That's also the reason I didn't write any tests.

The code can be compiled and run on Java 8 with no dependencies from any external libraries. I didn't focus on commiting any sort of build scripts and stuffs like this, only a code and text files with input data.
