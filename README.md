# Advent of Code 2016

Solutions for programming puzzles from the <a href='http://adventofcode.com/'>Advent of Code 2016</a> in Java. I scored 148 points total on this contest.

Solving this puzzles I tried to search for interesting solutions using only base Java API, specifically streams. The code written for fun and doesn't reflect my own programming style. Sometimes I safrificed optimality in return for beauty and compactness. As soon as an input data always known and more or less equal for any user the code often solves a puzzles for such input but not for any possible input.

The code can be compiled and run on Java 8 with no dependencies from any external libraries. I didn't focus on commiting any sort of build scripts and stuffs like this, only a code and text files with input data.
